  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Inspiration and content for this page were retrieved from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/chef-johns-jollof-rice-recipe-7499757">allrecipes.com</a></p>

  <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa's most popular dish. I like to serve it as a side with my West African-style grilled beef (Suya), but it can also be a main course.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

  <h3>Tomato Sauce:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered</li>
    <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 whole habanero pepper, stem removed</li>
    <li>1 whole Fresno chili, or jalapeño, stem removed</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rice:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1 red onion, diced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
    <li>2 1/4 cups basmati rice</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chicken bouillon paste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped green onion for garnish (optional)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro, for garnish (optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
    <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
    <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.</li>
    <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.</li>
    <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
  
  <p>If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again. </p>
